Coding Exercise: 

1.	Develop a REST API for representing Meta-Data with end points (GET, POST, PUT ,DELETE etc.). For example GET on /api/v1/location returns all location objects
a.	/api/v1/location, 
b.	/api/v1/location/{location_id}/department
c.	/api/v1/location/{location_id}/department/{department_id}/category
d.	/api/v1/location/{location_id}/department/{department_id}/category/{category_id}/subcategory
e.	/api/v1/location/{location_id}/department/{department_id}/category/{category_id}/subcategory/{subcategory_id}

2.	Persist the data in your favorite DB - relational or non-relational (You are expected to install, configure, populate the DB). You may feel free to qualify object representations with additional attributes to enhance modeling (For e.g. Location object attributes = locationid, location description)
3.	Write a api endpoint that takes input meta-data and returns all the SKU rows in the "Data" that matches with the input meta-data. 
a.	For example, for input meta-data (Perimeter, Bakery, Bakery Bread, Bagels) , return the rows with SKUs 1 & 14 (The actual data given to you might contain more rows)???
