Interviewer:  The interviewer may choose to ask other similar questions during the interview process 
Interviewee:  You may search online and find solutions to the below. Answer as many questions as you can in the time provided. You may use the programming language of your choice.

You will have to share your desktop while explaining the solution. You are expected to set up, configure and have the environment (infrastructure, runtime and libraries etc.) ready to solve the below questions on your personal desktop/laptop/cloud.  

Coding Exercise: 

1.	Develop a REST API for representing Meta-Data with end points (GET, POST, PUT ,DELETE etc.). For example GET on /api/v1/location returns all location objects
a.	/api/v1/location, 
b.	/api/v1/location/{location_id}/department
c.	/api/v1/location/{location_id}/department/{department_id}/category
d.	/api/v1/location/{location_id}/department/{department_id}/category/{category_id}/subcategory
e.	/api/v1/location/{location_id}/department/{department_id}/category/{category_id}/subcategory/{subcategory_id}

2.	Persist the data in your favorite DB - relational or non-relational (You are expected to install, configure, populate the DB). You may feel free to qualify object representations with additional attributes to enhance modeling (For e.g. Location object attributes = locationid, location description)
3.	Write a api endpoint that takes input meta-data and returns all the SKU rows in the "Data" that matches with the input meta-data. 
a.	For example, for input meta-data (Perimeter, Bakery, Bakery Bread, Bagels) , return the rows with SKUs 1 & 14 (The actual data given to you might contain more rows)
